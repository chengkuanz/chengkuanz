## Projects

### **[Motronome Resource Management System - QNX Neutrino](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Metronome-Resource-Manager-QNX)**

- Developed a Metronome Resource Manager for QNX Neutrino RTOS, simulating rhythmic patterns using C.
- Implemented multi-threading, pulse messaging, and timers to ensure accurate beat timing and responsiveness in the metronomeâ€™s operation.
- Designed and managed a command-line interface for controlling the metronome via QNX resource manager, enabling start, stop, pause, and configuration operations.
- Utilized QNX Neutrino's resource manager framework to integrate the metronome with the QNX filesystem, allowing interaction through device files.
- Automated testing of the metronome's functionality using a custom acceptance-test script to verify the correct functionality of the metronome in various scenarios, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

### **[Building Entry Controller System - QNX Neutrino](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Building-Entry-Controller-System-QNX)**

- Developed a simulation of a building entry controller system using C on the QNX Neutrino RTOS for the CST8244 - Real-Time Programming course.
- Designed and maintained a state machine a system to manage the entry and exit of individuals through a controlled two-door system using card scanners, a scale to weigh individuals, and manual guard-operated locks.
- Implemented semaphores, message passing, and shared memory to synchronize tasks and communicate between processes, ensuring real-time responsiveness and data integrity.
- Simulated and tested various entry scenarios, including invalid inputs and concurrent access, to validate system reliability and error handling.
- Worked with QNX Momentics IDE for development and debugging, and deployed the system on a real-time operating system.



### **[Fan Club Web Application - ASP.NET](https://github.com/chengkuanz/cst8359-Assignment2)**

- Developed and deployed a Fan Club Web Application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and Azure services.
- Implemented CRUD operations for fans, clubs, and news, with data integrity checks to maintain consistent relationships.
- Integrated a user-friendly interface for managing fan subscriptions and sport club data with capabilities to create, view, edit, and delete clubs, with proper handling of associated news and subscriptions.
- Developed a news management page for users to upload, view, and delete image items related to sport clubs.
- Deployed the application to Azure Web App, and use Azure Blob Storage for managing and storing media files, and Azure SQL Database for data storage.



### **[Simon Game - C++](https://github.com/chengkuanz/SimonGame)**      

- Developed an interactive Simon Game in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) libraries, testing players' memory with color sequences.
- Implemented game mechanics to generate and display random color sequences, enhancing gameplay difficulty with each level.
- Designed a responsive GUI with TGUI for an engaging user experience.
- Integrated unique sound effects with each color button to aid in memorization.
- Programmed logic for real-time user input validation and feedback.
- Enabled restart functionality and performance tracking to improve player engagement and retention.

### **[Picross Game - Java Swing](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Picross)**

- Developed a multiplayer Picross game in Java using the MVC architectural pattern.
- Implemented real-time communication between server and clients with Java Sockets.
- Designed an intuitive GUI using Swing for a responsive user experience.
- Created a modular structure (Model-View-Controller) for scalable and maintainable code.
- Automated build processes with batch scripts for compiling, JAR creation, and Javadoc generation.
- Enabled multiplayer interactions within a local area network, enhancing gaming experience and collaboration.

### **[Complier Design](https://github.com/chengkuanz/complier-design)**

- Developed front-end stage of a compiler in C, consisting of a Reader, Scanner, and Parser, for a custom programming language.
- Implemented a Reader module to manage dynamic memory for reading and storing input data, employing techniques like buffer handling and dynamic allocation.
- Created a Scanner module to tokenize input data, incorporating finite state machines, token attributes, and error handling for lexical analysis.
- Designed a Parser module for syntactic analysis, using recursive descent parsing and Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to validate the grammar and structure of the source code.
