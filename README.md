## Projects

### **[Building Entry Controller System - QNX](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Building-Entry-Controller-System-QNX)**

- Developed a simulation of a building entry controller system using C on the QNX Neutrino RTOS for the CST8244 - Real-Time Programming course.
- Designed and maintained a state machine a system to manage the entry and exit of individuals through a controlled two-door system using card scanners, a scale to weigh individuals, and manual guard-operated locks.
- Implemented semaphores, message passing, and shared memory to synchronize tasks and communicate between processes, ensuring real-time responsiveness and data integrity.
- Simulated and tested various entry scenarios, including invalid inputs and concurrent access, to validate system reliability and error handling.
- Worked with QNX Momentics IDE for development and debugging, and deployed the system on a real-time operating system.



### **[Fan Club Web Application](https://github.com/chengkuanz/cst8359-Assignment2)**

- Developed and deployed a Fan Club Web Application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and Azure services.
- Implemented CRUD operations for fans, clubs, and news, with data integrity checks to maintain consistent relationships.
- Integrated a user-friendly interface for managing fan subscriptions and sport club data with capabilities to create, view, edit, and delete clubs, with proper handling of associated news and subscriptions.
- Developed a news management page for users to upload, view, and delete image items related to sport clubs.
- Deployed the application to Azure Web App, and use Azure Blob Storage for managing and storing media files, and Azure SQL Database for data storage.



### **[Simon Game](https://github.com/chengkuanz/SimonGame)**      

- Developed an interactive Simon Game in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) libraries, testing players' memory with color sequences.
- Implemented game mechanics to generate and display random color sequences, enhancing gameplay difficulty with each level.
- Designed a responsive GUI with TGUI for an engaging user experience.
- Integrated unique sound effects with each color button to aid in memorization.
- Programmed logic for real-time user input validation and feedback.
- Enabled restart functionality and performance tracking to improve player engagement and retention.

### **[Picross Game](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Picross)**

- Developed a multiplayer Picross game in Java using the MVC architectural pattern.
- Implemented real-time communication between server and clients with Java Sockets.
- Designed an intuitive GUI using Swing for a responsive user experience.
- Created a modular structure (Model-View-Controller) for scalable and maintainable code.
- Automated build processes with batch scripts for compiling, JAR creation, and Javadoc generation.
- Enabled multiplayer interactions within a local area network, enhancing gaming experience and collaboration.

### **[Complier Design](https://github.com/chengkuanz/complier-design)**

- Developed front-end stage of a compiler in C, consisting of a Reader, Scanner, and Parser, for a custom programming language.
- Implemented a Reader module to manage dynamic memory for reading and storing input data, employing techniques like buffer handling and dynamic allocation.
- Created a Scanner module to tokenize input data, incorporating finite state machines, token attributes, and error handling for lexical analysis.
- Designed a Parser module for syntactic analysis, using recursive descent parsing and Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to validate the grammar and structure of the source code.      


### **[Personal Website](https://chengkuanz.github.io/)**

  (3600 RPM, 50 MW nominal power) using a gas turbine (8500 RPM). 
- Created detailed CAD model for all components, including the pinion and gear, the
  shafts each gear mounted on, and the casing. 
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of the gears' fatigue life, critical speed, and minimum allowable diameter for shafts.
- Evaluated the life of bearings and selected appropriate fasteners, sealing methods, and assembly techniques.
- Designed the lubrication circulation system and analyzed heat dissipation requirements.

### **Sterling Engine Design and Manufacture**
- School Project, MECH 4705 CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing), September 2020 – December 2020
- Modeled, assembled, and generated toolpaths for the Stirling engine in Fusion360 based on provided shop drawings.

- Designed soft jaws for safely clamping parts during the milling operation.
- Analyzed and reported differences in dimensions between the programmed tool paths and measured dimensions, including theoretical and provided cutting feeds and speeds.


### **Advanced Urban Air Mobility (UAM) VTOL Aircraft Design**
- 4th Year Capstone Project, MAAE 4907A Advanced Aircraft Design, September 2020 – April 2021
- Collaborated with a group of ten to design an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL).
- Designed, modeled, and created engineering drawings for the landing gear assembly and the transmission system using Fusion 360.   
- Developed a Python program to automatically calculate key parameters of the transmission system.
- Performed finite element analysis (FEA) on the landing gear assembly using ANSYS Workbench and Explicit Dynamics to evaluate its performance and ensure compliance with aviation standards.
- Developed technical reports on the landing gear design and related analyses.
- Delivered technical presentations detailing the design to over ten professional audiences.
