## Projects

### **[Personal Website](https://chengkuanz.github.io/)**    

- A personal portfolio website that was built using [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) theme, customized and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).        

### **[Simon Game](https://github.com/chengkuanz/SimonGame)**      

- Developed an interactive Simon Game in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) libraries, testing players' memory with color sequences.
- Implemented game mechanics to generate and display random color sequences, enhancing gameplay difficulty with each level.
- Designed a responsive GUI with TGUI for an engaging user experience.
- Integrated unique sound effects with each color button to aid in memorization.
- Programmed logic for real-time user input validation and feedback.
- Enabled restart functionality and performance tracking to improve player engagement and retention.

### **[Picross Game](https://github.com/chengkuanz/Picross)**

- Developed a multiplayer Picross game in Java using the MVC architectural pattern.
- Implemented real-time communication between server and clients with Java Sockets.
- Designed an intuitive GUI using Swing for a responsive user experience.
- Created a modular structure (Model-View-Controller) for scalable and maintainable code.
- Automated build processes with batch scripts for compiling, JAR creation, and Javadoc generation.
- Enabled multiplayer interactions within a local area network, enhancing gaming experience and collaboration.

### **[Complier Design](https://github.com/chengkuanz/complier-design)**

- Developed front-end stage of a compiler in C, consisting of a Reader, Scanner, and Parser, for a custom programming language.
- Implemented a Reader module to manage dynamic memory for reading and storing input data, employing techniques like buffer handling and dynamic allocation.
- Created a Scanner module to tokenize input data, incorporating finite state machines, token attributes, and error handling for lexical analysis.
- Designed a Parser module for syntactic analysis, using recursive descent parsing and Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to validate the grammar and structure of the source code.
